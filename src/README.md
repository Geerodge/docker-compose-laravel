## This is where your Laravel app goes

To get started, **delete this file** and then do one of the following:

- Clone your project or copy all of the files directly into this `src` directory.
- Spin up the Docker network by following the instructions on the main [README.md](../README.md), and install a brand new Laravel project using one of the following commands:
  - If you're using the composer docker container. by running `docker-compose run --rm composer create-project laravel/laravel`.
  - If you're using composer locally (outside of the docker container) use `curl -s https://laravel.build/example-app | bash`.
